# Aleph

Version of the FCCAnalyses code that supports command line arguments, to be able to process both data and MC with the same script. Nightlies version of the key4hep stack is required for this. 

## Setup

Folow the steps described in the general [README](../README.md) at the top level to setup the code, then just `cd src`. 
 
<!-- ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apranikstar/Aleph.git
cd Aleph
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd FCCAnalyses
fccanalysis build -j 8
cd ../src
source /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh #or compile and source the FCCAnalyses module.
```

Need nightlies because updated FCCAnalyses version after this commit is needed: https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCAnalyses/pull/474 -->

## Stage1: Produce ntuples

Note: Change the data fraction based on your needs.

### Run on MC:
```bash
fccanalysis run stage1.py -- --tag <version_tag>  --MCflavour <flavour_index>
```

Output files will be in: 
`/eos/experiment/fcc/ee/analyses/case-studies/aleph/processedMC/<year>/<mc_type>/stage1/<version_tag>/<flavour_name>.root`. 

Fraction of events to process can be set via `--fraction <val>`, default is to process all events. 

`--year <year>` and `--MCtype <type>` are also supported command line arguments, currently we only have `1994` and `zqq` here. 

### Run on data:
```bash
fccanalysis run stage1.py -- --tag <version_tag> --doData 
```

Output files will be in: `/eos/experiment/fcc/ee/analyses/case-studies/aleph/processedData/<year>/stage1/<version_tag>/`

`--year` and `--fraction` is also supported as an argument here. 

`--noDedxGate` (data and MC) accepts every linked dE/dx measurement as valid, i.e. switches off the failed-leg omega sentinel gate. Use it with converters that no longer copy the track omega into a failed leg.

`pfcand_d0` and `pfcand_z0` are the **raw** perigee impact parameters of the track linked to each jet constituent, taken from the stored track state: referenced to the coordinate origin, in cm, in the LCIO sign convention (the ALEPH→LCIO flip of `D0` and `omega` is applied; the `pfcand_*` covariance branches are read from the same flipped collection). They are *not* recomputed at the primary vertex — `pfcand_dxy` and `pfcand_dz` are the PV-referenced ones. A constituent with no track (a neutral) carries the guard value −9 in both, again as for the covariance branches; the PV-referenced `pfcand_dxy/dz/phi0/C/ct` also read −9 for a charge-0 constituent that carries a track link.

The −9 sentinel of `pfcand_d0`/`pfcand_z0` lies inside the physical range of those variables, so the safe test for "no track" is the track link itself (or exact equality with −9), not a range cut.

`pfcand_C` is now half the fitted curvature, |omega|/2 in 1/cm, signed by the charge. It was previously Bz·c/(2 pT) from the energy-flow pT in 1/mm, so both the scale (a factor 10) and the source differ — the latter matters for V0 daughters, whose energy-flow momentum is quoted at the V0 vertex.

`pfcand_dEdx_pads_type` and `pfcand_dEdx_wires_type` are no longer a validity mask: an accepted leg can carry any type and a rejected one reads −9 in value, error and type, so test the value branch rather than `type == 0`.

### Reconstruction modules: defaults and opt-outs

A flag-less `stage1.py` runs the two-tier V0 module ([`analyzer_v0new.h`](analyzer_v0new.h)) on top of the standard chain, writing the `v0n_*`/`v0njet_*` branches. On MC the truth-matching branches (`truev0_*`, `v0c_*`, `v0n_class`, ...) are added automatically; they are skipped under `--doData`.

The legacy code path remains available as an opt-out:

| flag | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--oldV0` | drop the two-tier V0 module: no `v0n_*`/`v0njet_*` and no V0 truth branches. The legacy `v0_*` block is unaffected. |

The selection is not configurable from the command line: every tuned value is a named `constexpr` in the header that uses it, and that declaration is its only definition. The paragraphs below describe the selection in words; the numbers quoted are those declarations.

### The two-tier V0 module

Standalone V0 (Ks/Λ) reconstruction in [`analyzer_v0new.h`](analyzer_v0new.h). It runs on the primary vertex of the standard chain (`VertexObject_looseBS`) and on the secondary tracks that vertex leaves unclaimed (`SecondaryTracks_looseBS`). It is *V0-first* by design: its track claims are meant to be consumed by later finders, so the module optimises the correctness of each claim, not just the candidate list.

**Candidate building.** All opposite-charge secondary track pairs are vertexed with a single consistent fit (`VertexFitter_Tk`); every downstream quantity (momenta, invariant masses under both hypotheses, Armenteros–Podolanski (AP) variables, pointing) is derived from the refitted momenta at that vertex — there is no second fit.

**Two selection tiers, evaluated per hypothesis (Ks and Λ):**

- **Tight** — the adopted physics selection: mass window; momentum-tiered pointing cut (separate Ks and Λ ladders, `ksPointThr` / `lamPointThr`); a qT veto against photon conversions (Λ only); and a resolution-scaled AP-band cut around the exact kinematic locus — the band half-width follows the measured σ_ell(p) of each species (`ksBandThr`, `lamBandThrTight`; the Λ band is floored at low p and capped at the nominal ramp edge), plus common fit-quality (χ²) and displacement requirements.
- **Loose** — the ML-training tier: same windows/χ²/displacement, but flat pointing, a wider Ks AP band, a Λ AP band equal to a fixed fraction (0.8) of the ramp half-width floored at the tight band, and a relaxed Λ qT veto. It is a strict superset of tight and is what gets stored, so *any* tighter selection (including the historical ones) can be re-derived offline from any production.

**Hypothesis arbitration.** A pair passing both hypotheses is booked as the one whose invariant mass is closer to its window centre (normalised by the window half-width).

**Exclusive claiming, tight first.** Candidates claim their tracks exclusively in quality order: all tight candidates claim before any loose one, and within a tier the best-χ² candidate claims first. A track is claimed once; later candidates using it are dropped. This preserves the tight-only output exactly regardless of the loose tier.

**Stored flags and ML inputs.** `v0n_tight` re-derives the adopted tight package offline from the same single-source helpers (booking a candidate ≠ selecting it — variant productions still carry the adopted-package flag). Any tighter selection is re-derivable offline from the stored loose tier. `v0n_bandSig` and `v0n_massSig` store the AP-band and mass cut variables as signed pulls in resolution units for training; all other cut variables (cosPointing, pointSig, qT, χ², displacement, p, invM) are stored raw.

**Output branches.** Two groups, both written by default and both dropped by `--oldV0`:

- `n_v0n_event`, `v0n_pdg`, `v0n_invM`, `v0n_alpha`, `v0n_qt`, `v0n_chi2`, `v0n_dxyz`, `v0n_p`, `v0n_px/py/pz`, `v0n_cosPointing`, `v0n_pointSig`, `v0n_tight`, `v0n_bandSig`, `v0n_massSig`, `v0n_vx/vy/vz`, the vertex-fit covariance `v0n_cov_*`, the daughter joins `v0n_trk1_origIdx`/`v0n_trk2_origIdx` and their `v0n_trk{1,2}_dEdx_{pads,wires}_{value,error}` and `v0n_trk{1,2}_isChargedHad` — event-order candidate quantities, independent of jet assignment.
- `n_v0njet_jets`, `n_v0njet_ks`, `n_v0njet_lambda` and `v0njet_*` — the new candidates pushed through the same per-jet assignment and jet-relative getters as the existing `v0_*` block, so old vs new is an apples-to-apples comparison at jet level.

The truth-matching branches (`v0n_class`, `v0n_trueidx`, `v0n_pairmult`, `v0n_trackshared`, `v0n_trk1`, `v0n_trk2`, `truev0_foundnew_*`, `truev0_*`, `v0c_*`) are MC only — they are skipped under `--doData`.

**Further utilities in the headers.** [`analyzer_truth.h`](analyzer_truth.h) carries the MC truth-matching utilities (true-V0 finding, track↔MC index recovery, candidate truth classification) used to derive the tunings above; it is loaded unconditionally, because its truth-FREE candidate accessors (`candChi2`, `candDxyz`, `candP`, `candPcomp`, `candCosPointing`, `candVtxPos`) and index maps are also used on data. [`analyzer_trkaux.h`](analyzer_trkaux.h) holds the shared vertex-fit glue and the track→`ReconstructedParticle` join behind the per-leg particle-flow label; it is loaded unconditionally as well.

### Index maps and per-leg labels

`prim2origIdx` and `sec2origIdx` map the primary and secondary track collections back to the original `Tracks` index space, which is the frame the `v0n_trk{1,2}_origIdx` branches use; both are written on data too, since the matching is truth-free. Every candidate leg additionally carries `<leg>_isChargedHad`, a tri-state particle-flow label: 1 = the leg's linked reconstructed particle is a PF charged hadron, 0 = it is an electron, muon or another type, −1 = the track has no linked reconstructed particle (mostly very soft tracks, below the PF momentum reach). The label uses the same particle-flow type codes as `pfcand_isChargedHad`.

### Run on batch:
```
fccanalysis submit stage1.py -- --tag VXX-XX --MCflavour X --batch --chunks X
```

### STAGE 2:

Don't touch stage2.py!
Open up stage2_all.py and change the desired input and output directories. 
Set the number of cpus.
Now you can decide if you want to divide each flavor into multiple files, then you can change the argument `n_final_files`.
Run it with nightlies.
